A responsive and modern portfolio website for the Multimedia Onfield team at school. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and hosted on **GitHub Pages**.

## Features

- Toggleable **Dark Mode** with smooth transitions  
- Fully responsive and mobile-friendly  
- Custom toggle switch with sun/moon icon for theme  

## Limitations

Because this site is hosted on **GitHub Pages**, features that require a backend (e.g., sending emails via PHP) are **not available**.

To enable the contact form, please use a third-party service like:

- [Formspree](https://formspree.io/)
- [EmailJS](https://emailjs.com/)
- Or host your own backend (PHP, Node.js, etc.)
